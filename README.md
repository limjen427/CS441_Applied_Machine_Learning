## Assignments

### Assignment 2: Trees and MLPs
Add a penguin classification task to our repertoire and explore trees, ensembles, and MLPs.
- Explore the impact of model complexity while applying regression trees, random forests, and boosted regression trees.
- Get experience with training and applying MLPs
- Gain exposure to using correct methodologies for learning rate selection and testing
- Get practice analyzing features and selecting and designing models for open problems

### Assignment 3: Application Domains and Foundation Models
- Use a popular foundation model, CLIP, and its application on image classification tasks. 
- Use two visual datasets: Oxford 102 Flower and Oxford-IIIT Pet.
- Learn how to use the vision-language model CLIP to perform new classification tasks, such as zero-shot, linear probe, or nearest neighbor.
- Fine-tune a pre-trained ImageNet network to perform a custom classification task
- Learn about the application of AI and reflect on its potential impact, good and bad.
- experiment with word tokenizers and design a custom network.

### Assignment 4: Dealing with Data
Explore clustering, retrieval, density estimation, and data visualization
using MNIST digits, as well as a few images. 
- Experiment with k-means and its ability to group data in valuable ways without supervision
- Compare how fast search techniques can make nearest-neighbor retrieval much more efficient
- Compare different strategies for estimating the probability density functions of variables
- Learn how to use data projections, particularly PCA, to compress and visualize
